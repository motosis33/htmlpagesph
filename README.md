## Detailed Project Description



## Notes about Implementation and Further Development
Currently, our website is being implemented through HTML, a .py file, and a Flask app. This is very rough due to the timeframe and issues with the Web API. 
In the future, we plan to implement this project using the Web API to more easily pull the data and run the code.
