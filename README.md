# WMR: Powering your work out, *your* way

Welcome to our Website!
*WMR* (wee-mur) is a Workout Music Recommendation App!!

## User Story
- [x] User sees a "Go to Spotify Login" button.
- [x] User logs in with their Spotify page!
- [x] User's data is pulled (with authorization).
- [x] User's top 10 artists are pulled.
- [x] User can select their workout type (cardio, strength, or flexibility) and intensity level (moderate or high).
- [x] User can access and listen to their curated playlist while working out.

## Detailed Project Description
*WMR* is a web application that creates a personalized playlist of songs from your favorite artists depending on your workout. The website is implemented through the integration of HTML, a .py file, and a Flask app. It allows the user to log in to their Spotify account, gathers data about the users top 5 artists, and tailors a playlist based on the type of workout you do to keep you motivated. This playlist is based on parameters we created for energy, valence, loudness, and tempo for each combination of workout and intensity. 


## Notes about Implementation and Further Development
In the future, we plan to implement this project using the Web API to more easily pull the data and run the code. We would also like to launch our application in the form of a mobile application to make it more accessible to the users.
